# hello-react-front-end

> This exercise is to create a react app which will serve as the front end app for my rails back end app

## The learning objective of this project are

- Create react front end app
- Connect react front end app to rails back end
- Use API end point to get data


## Built With

- React
- API

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#prerequisites)

### Setup
- ```git clone https://github.com/julie-ify/hello-react-front-end.git```

- ```cd hello-react-front-end```

### Running The App

- Run `npm install`

- Make sure to run my [Rails backend application](https://github.com/julie-ify/hello-rails-back-end) first before running the React app so that it takes up the `port 3000`. This is very important as my rails API end point must run on `port 3000` for the API to work.
- Once the back end is runing on `port 3000` then start the react app and you will be prompted to run the server on another port like `port 3001`. You will receive a message in your terminal like this `Would you like to run the app on another port instead? ¬ª (Y/n)`. Please enter `y` so that the react app will start on `port 3001`.
